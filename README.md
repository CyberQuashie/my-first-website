Welcome! [code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

"git add ." adds the changes to my git hum 

git commit -m "put message here" -- commits the changes and inputs a message describing changes

"git push" fully pushes the changes over to my repository not just on vs code

python3 -m http.server

"control +c" stops terminal running 

"command s" saves changes made on vs code
